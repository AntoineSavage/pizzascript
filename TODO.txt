replace AstExpr with quoted PzVal (eval becomes unquote, quote becomes id, unquote becomes double-unquote, etc)
add mfi (maybe function identifier) to error messages
add back enough pos stuff to have stack traces and debug info

error messages use show. Use unparse instead

test/rename reduce (aka Acc stuff)

error handling context field handling
I/O context field handling

base:
    - defun, cond, list, dict
